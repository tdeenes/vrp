//! The *solver* module contains basic building blocks for a metaheuristic among with the default
//! implementation.
//!
//! # Metaheuristic
//!
//! A metaheuristic is a high-level algorithmic framework that provides a set of guidelines or strategies
//! to develop heuristic optimization algorithms. Examples of metaheuristics include genetic/evolutionary
//! algorithms, tabu search, simulated annealing, variable neighborhood search, (adaptive) large
//! neighborhood search, ant colony optimization, etc.
//!
//! The default implementation can be roughly described as "*Multi-objective Parthenogenesis based
//! Evolutionary Algorithm with Ruin and Recreate Mutation Operator*".
//!
//! # Multi-objective decision maker
//!
//! Most VRPs, frequently used to model real cases, are set up with a single objective (e.g. minimizing
//! the cost of the solution), however the majority of the problems encountered in logistics industry,
//! are multi-objective in nature as the complexity of real-life logistics planning often cannot be
//! reduced to cost only. Such non-cost factors are:
//!
//! - **balancing work across multiple workers**
//! - **minimization or maximization of fleet usage**
//! - **minimization of unassigned jobs**
//!
//! In most of the cases, these additional factors are contradicting to the cost minimization
//! objective which, in fact, leads to nontrivial multi-objective optimization problem, where no
//! single solution exists that simultaneously optimizes each objective.
//!
//! That's why the concept of dominance is introduced: a solution is said to dominate another
//! solution if its quality is at least as good on every objective and better on at least one.
//! The set of all non-dominated solutions of an optimization problem is called the Pareto set and
//! the projection of this set onto the objective function space is called the Pareto front.
//!
//! The aim of multi-objective metaheuristics is to approximate the Pareto front as closely as
//! possible (Zitzler et al., 2004) and therefore generate a set of mutually non-dominated solutions
//! called the Pareto set approximation.
//!
//! This library utilizes `NSGA-II` algorithm to apply Pareto-based ranking over population in order
//! to find Pareto set approximation. However, that Pareto optimality of the solutions cannot be
//! guaranteed: it is only known that none of the generated solutions dominates the others.
//! In the end, the top ranked individual is returned as best known solution.
//!
//! This crate contains NSGA-II buildings blocks which can be found in [`nsga2`] module.
//!
//! [`nsga2`]: ../algorithms/nsga2/index.html
//!
//! # Evolutionary algorithm
//!
//! An evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a generic population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm.
//! This crate provides a custom implementation of EA which can be divided into the following steps:
//!
//! - **initialization**: on this step, an initial population is created using different construction
//!    heuristics.
//! - **main loop begin**: enter an evolution loop
//!     - **selection**: an individual is selected from population. Best-fit individuals have more
//!        chances to be selected.
//!     - **mutation**: a mutation operator is applied to selected individual. Default implementation
//!       uses `ruin and recreate` principle described in next section.
//!     - **population adjustments**: new individual is added to population, then the population is
//!       sorted and shrinked to keep it under specific size limits with best-fit individuals and
//!       some intermediate.
//! - **main loop end**: exit evolution loop when one of termination criteria are met. See [`termination`]
//!       module for details.
//!
//! As there is no crossover operator involved and offspring is produced from one parent, this algorithm
//! can be characterized as parthenogenesis based EA. This approach eliminates design of feasible
//! crossover operator which is a challenging task in case of VRP.
//!
//!  [`termination`]: termination/index.html
//!
//! # Ruin and Recreate principle
//!
//! A **ruin and recreate** principle is introduced by [`Schrimpf et al. (2000)`] and key idea here
//! is to ruin a quite large fraction of the solution and try to restore the solution as best as it
//! is possible in order to get a new solution better than the previous one. Original algorithm can
//! be described as a large neighborhood search that combines elements of simulated annealing and
//! threshold-accepting algorithms, but this crate only reuses ruin/recreate idea as a mutation
//! operator.
//!
//! Implementation blocks can be found in [`mutation`] module.
